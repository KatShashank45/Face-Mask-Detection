## Introduction

This Python project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It can be used for various applications, such as monitoring compliance with face mask mandates, enhancing safety and security, or for educational purposes.

The project leverages the power of deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV to perform real-time face mask detection on images or video streams from webcams or video files.
